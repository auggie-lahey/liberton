The Bylaws of the Commons

# Definition and Purposes
## DEFINITION
* "The Commons"
    * the property held in a TBD LEGAL ENTITY for community use of its members. It is intended as a community farm owned and operated by the members, who share its outputs and equipment, and share responsibility for the conservation of that land via regenerative agricultural practices, education, and other needs and amenities considered desirable, insofar as the community is able to provide them.
* Community 
    * Throughout these Bylaws, when the word community is used in the sense that implies that the community makes decisions, such references shall be interpreted to mean that the central decision making body of the community shall make the decisions referred to, under the provisions of the article on Government hereof. All other references mean the collection of members.


## PURPOSES
  1. We are creating a society which offers its members an opportunity to live freely.
  2. We are creating a society where positions of responsibility are not positions of exploitation
  3. We reject the idea that some people are seen as &quot;more equal&quot; than others.
  4. We are creating a society which is non-violent but well armed, where people mutually respect and tolerate individual differences of belief, opinions, and taste, and personal property.
  5. We are building a society that responsibly maintains all natural resources for itself, future generations, and for all people through an ecologically sound lifestyle. The agrarian culture is central to this community and bringing new and young people to farming is the only way it will last.
  6. We are striving to be self-reliant, especially in cooperation with similar groups.
  7. To the greatest extent possible, the trade in which we engage will promote and contribute to the growth and maintenance of a free and decentralized economy.
  8. We are perpetuating our community in such a way that it will be available to succeeding generations.
  9. We are growing and will maintain a membership of at least X members, as rapidly as is consistent with our survival.
  10. We are creating a society benefiting its members but also serving as an example of social organization applicable to the rest of the world.
  11. We are publicizing this lifestyle in order to serve as an example of social organization applicable to the rest of the world, and we promote the formation and growth of similar communities.

## The definition and purposes shall be implemented by:
  1. The use of experimentation to discover and encourage the desirable behaviors for the group&#39;s members and its government.
  2. A system of internal economics that, so far as is feasible, makes material benefits of the community available to all members according to their share.
  3. A general practice respecting the liberty of each individual member to as great an extent as is consistent with the well-being of the community and the laws of the government in whose jurisdiction it resides.
  4. An emphasis on promoting cooperation rather than competition among the members. (hmm?)
  5. A dedication to a non-violent, non-exploitative way of life for all human beings, and specifically an insistence on non-involvement of members in actions contrary to this policy.
### In no event shall the resources or facilities of this community be used to further in any manner any project, activity, or purpose of any group or individual that is inconsistent with the purposes of this community as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws.

# Membership
## CLASSES OF MEMBERS
### There are three classes of members in the community; full members, provisional members and child members.
* A full member is a person who has been accepted as such according to the conditions of Article Two, Paragraph 2A.
    * Each full member is entitled to an equal vote on issues of override, impeachment, and Bylaws amendments.
    * To pay SOME AMOUNT.
* A provisional member is a person who has been accepted by the Community on a trial basis for a period not shorter than three months nor longer than two years.
    * Provisional members are entitled to the same rights and responsible for the same duties as full members, with the following exceptions:
        * Provisional members do not have guaranteed tenure in the community and may be asked to leave at any time for any reason, according to procedures approved by the community&#39;s decision-making body.
        * Provisional members may vote when the current governmental system permits them to vote. They may not vote on issues of override, impeachment, and Bylaws amendments.
* A child member is any member either accepted into the community or born within it who has, according to the governing process of the community, not reached a maturity when they should be expected to carry a full work load. Child members may be given fractional voting rights or full votes in specific areas by action of the central decision making body. A vote of a majority of the full members can override any committee, manager or other body which may be empowered to determine when a child member may become a full member. Child members who become adults according to our regulations may be accepted as full members in the same way as people who join as adults, with the exception that they will not be required to go through a period of provisional membership.

## METHODS OF ADMISSION AND EXPULSION.
* Admission The community&#39;s government shall devise and revise, at its discretion, appropriate procedures for the admission of persons to the status of provisional member, child member, and full member.
* Full membership shall be for the life of the member, unless terminated by one of the following:
    * The voluntary resignation of a member from the community.
    * The expulsion of the member by the central decision making body.
* Full members may be expelled only for specific reasons, as follows:
    * Physical violence against another person, defined as an act of physical aggression judged by the community to have been deliberate, hostile, painful and/or dangerous, and provided that the community holds the view that such action is likely to be repeated.
    * Theft of communal or private property.
    * Not paying dues
    * Missing 50% of required yearly meetings.
    * Knowingly making false declaration of the extent or disposition of property when entering the community or subsequently, or violating the community&#39;s property code with regard to the disposition of said property, or the disposition of any income.
    * Deliberate attempts to destroy or disband the community by any means, legal, extra-legal, financial, or any other manner, provided that this shall not be broadly interpreted to refer to the holding or proclaiming of disapproved opinions. This is intended to refer specifically to making trouble between the community and civil authorities, involving us in a lawsuit, or in unauthorized financial obligations, and similar acts or attempts at same.
    * The above causes for expulsion may, but need not, be used by the central government according to its discretion, in individual cases. That is, this body may expel members for the above reasons and these reasons only, but need not expel members even for these reasons if they do not think it wise or necessary, and according to the best interests of the community at that time as they see it. They also have the option of putting an offending member back on provisional status or to institute specific mandatory behavioral programs in order to change a member&#39;s behavior. (These options exist only when a member has behaved in such a way that the alternative is expulsion.)
* Former members of the community who left voluntarily may re-enter as provisional members under the same conditions as persons who are entering for the first time. Any person who has been expelled and wishes to reenter must get special permission from the central decision making body.

# USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUTPUTS.
* The community may engage in any economic activity which it believes to be ethical, practical and legal.
* All income from all business engaged in on the commons shall be the property of the commons and shall be expended or distributed according to its laws, customs and discretion. It shall not be the property of any individual.
* All community expenses, business and otherwise, shall be obligations of the commons, and no individual member shall bear private obligations for them.

# PROPERTY OWNED BY MEMBERS
* All funds received by members before, during or after their membership, shall be the private property of that member alone and not the community. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * dividends from stocks and bonds
    * interest on savings
    * alimony
    * rents
    * unemployment compensation
    * welfare payments
    * social security payments
    * inheritances
    * proceeds from the sale of services or goods owned
    * royalties from works produced
    * tax returns
    * gifts from relatives and friends
    * money
    * precious metals
    * cryptocurrency

* Provided that personal property is to be kept on the member&#39;s personal land, this community has no authority over it. If members elect to share such property with the group and indicate this intention by placing such items in the commons, then the item will be treated like community property. The members may withdraw their personal items from public use at will and may take them with them if they wish upon departure. The community will not be responsible for the condition of any such property, whether shared or not. The community reserves the right to declare any object objectionable, and to require, in unusual situations, that the property be kept on the members private property only.

* Items which have not specifically been mentioned in this section should be sided with the owner.

# Government
## OPTIONS

The commons may, within the confines of these Bylaws, govern itself by any reasonable means which its members desire, and may, under any of such systems, either elect or appoint officers, committees, or decision makers, as it sees fit. Also, it may change its form of government at any time and as many times as it wishes, provided only the following:

That at all times and under any and all forms of government, a two-thirds majority of the full members, as defined by these Bylaws, may make, modify, or reverse any decision made by any decision maker(s) or process, and that the decision of this two-thirds majority is binding upon the community (unless and except such a decision be in violation of these Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation). Likewise, a two-thirds majority of full members may remove from office any officer or decision maker for any reason.

That any change from one form of government to another form shall be arrived at by normal process of the form of government that precedes it, or else by a vote of the aforesaid two-thirds majority of full members.

In the event of a proposed change from one basic form of government to another (such as from democracy to a planner system, or from a planner system to consensus), such new form of government must be proposed and the proposal publicly posted for the information of the members a full 30 days before the change can be implemented. However, in the case of a two-thirds majority overrule, this restriction does not apply.

After five years of any one form of government, a vote of confidence shall be called. If the existing form of government does not receive a majority vote of confidence of the full members, that form of government shall be replaced as soon as a new form can be devised and receives a majority vote of the full members.

All meetings at which any decision is going to be made, except those portions of meetings when decisions about specific individuals are being made, shall be open to any member who chooses to attend. Central decision making body meetings will be posted with an agenda, at least 36 hours in advance, except for emergency meetings.

## COMMUNITY RECORDS.
* The following community records will be available for study by any community member:

    - Legal documents.
    - Financial accounting records.
    - Labor accounting records.
    - Records of government and managerial decisions (except secret ballot forms).
    - Other items determined by the central decision making body.
    - Other items not listed above (1 through 5) including managerial records, except materials referring to specific individuals at the manager&#39;s discretion. Such materials will, however, be open to the individual.

* Specific pieces of information can be withheld from anyone except full members for designated periods of time by a decision of the central decision making body.

# Dissolution

The community may be dissolved by a two-thirds majority of the full members. In the event of the dissolution of the community, any assets remaining after the payment of the community&#39;s debts shall be divided equally among the existing full members.

# Accounting?

Each year the community will allocate money amounting to no less than the amount of depreciation of the community&#39;s property and equipment during the preceding year. This annual allocation is to go in to a fund which may be drawn on at any time but only for the following types of expenditures:

- Major maintenance or replacement of the community&#39;s buildings, equipment, or utilities.
- New construction or acquisition of community buildings, equipment, or utilities.
- Land improvements.
- Principal debt repayment on loans to the extent the loan money was used for any of the above purposes. If this is done the original loan money will not count in meeting the requirements of this Paragraph 1.

Generally accepted accounting principles will be followed in determining the annual amount of depreciation.

This annual allocation may not be waived during any year unless substantial cuts are made in the per capita spending for consumption. The allocation may also be waived in any year in which a large, unusual and unavoidable expense occurs.

Any money in the fund which will not be needed in the near term for the purposes stated in Paragraph 1 may be used by the community for short term cash needs (10 months or less).

## Area Departments and Divisions

### General intent

Departments will handle resources for the division(s) within their area. They will be expected to balance the interests of the community with those of the department. Because of the flexibility in allocating resources, departments will be able to focus resources more effectively. If a department has no divisions, the manager is a department head. All department and division managers are elected.

* Responsible for:
    - Overall planning, coordination and management of the activities within the area.
    - Insuring communication within and between divisions.
    - Posting policies prior to a final decision.

* Authority to:

    - Allocate and reallocate resources (money and labor) within the area including establishing reserves for projects, buffers and overruns. And in doing so, to the best of its ability, fulfilling the intent of community legislation.
    - Decide on appeals.
    - Set resource parameters within which divisions will operate.

* List of departments and their divisions
    - AgroForestry Department:
        - Livestock Division
        - Horticulture Division
    - Building, Utilities, Ground Department (THIS NEEDS A BETTER NAME)
        - Food Services Division
        - Grounds Division
    - Security Department
        - Communications Division
        - Firing Range Division

### AgroForestry Department

#### General Intent

The AgroForestry Department is established to implement the Silvopasture Plan (needs to be created and attached). The AgroForestry Department is broken down into the Livestock Division and Horticulture Division. If the community and its resources grow, the Livestock and Horticulture Divisions should be broken down into further specialized subdivisions if the number of number of managers exceeds 3. They should be trying to increase the calories produced while taking into account the communities tastes and dietary constraints to the extent possible within the budget authorized. Variety and economy should be their first goals, closely followed by regenerative agricultural practices. For example, let&#39;s not produce grain on 20 acres if we can buy the same product for $50.

An example of this expansion plan:

- Livestock Division
  - Ruminants Manager
  - Poultry Manager
  - Hog Manager
  - Fibers Manager

Could become

- Livestock Division
  - Large Animals Division
    - Cattle Manager
    - Alpaca Manager
    - Hog Manager
  - Small Animals Division
    - Shepherd
    - Poultry Manager

SOME AREA is a designated agroforestry zone, to be managed by this department bounded by the map on the SilvoPasture Plan. The area is to remain largely wooded, with selective harvesting of existing trees to create openings for new plantings. The area may eventually be used for animals, but any farm animals placed in this area will need the approval of and coordination between the horticulture division and livestock division, and should also have a concerns note put to community if it&#39;s the first time such animals will be run through there. Any permanent fencing installed in the area should also have a concerns note posted beforehand.

AgroForestry Department shall be given a budget each fiscal year of no less than $Y to purchase necessary equipment (budget needs to be created and attached).

#### Livestock Division
* Responsible for:
    * Ruminants
    * Poultry
    * Fencing
    * the dairy herds, barns, milk processing and budget
    * Aquaculture

~~As a branch the ranch would elect a branch manager and a representative to the agriculture committee.~~

The owner of any pet is liable for any livestock losses due to the animal. If a settlement cannot be reached the Ranch Manager will present information about the livestock&#39;s worth to the Board. The Board will then settle a fair price for the member of the pet to pay to the commons for the livestock.

The price for chickens (with a current feed price of $X/pound) is as follows:
* Chick (three weeks or younger): $Y
* Meat chicken (older than 3 weeks): $Z
* Egg layer pullet (older than three weeks, younger than 16 weeks): $A
* Grown Chicken (older than 16 weeks): $B

These prices are intended to deter pet owners from letting their pets eat livestock. The payment should be negotiable between the pet owner, the ranch manager and the Board in the event of a special &quot;one time&quot; circumstance (such as: dog jumping into the brooder box and eating 200 chicks or dog getting into the chicken coop and killing 12 egg layers). However, if the pet owner has been warned and the animal still kills livestock payment of the fee to community will not be optional, and in the event of refusing to pay it will be deducted from their food share.

The price of feed will change, therefore with time the monetary value of the livestock will change; this change in price must go through the policy concerns process.

If a guest&#39;s pet kills livestock and the guest does not pay the fee, it is the responsibility of the member guesting the person who owns the pet to pay the fee to community.

People shall be entitled to the same vote they have at community meetings in elections.

## Proxies

When a voting member is away they may leave a proxy with another member. A proxy gives one the right to vote for and in behalf of the absent member. The proxy may be exercised if the member is gone for the duration of a voting period, whether it be a membership vote, election, or proposal ballot. It does not apply in the case of procedural votes in community meeting. The member holding the proxy may vote in whatever way they feel appropriate (need not vote in the way that the absent member would wish and may exercise the proxy selectively or not at all). The proxy must be signed and dated and must indicate the name of the person who holds the proxy. The proxy must be shown to the person who counts the vote in question.

In addition, if a voting member is absent for the duration of any sort of vote mentioned above, they may register their vote on the phone with a Board member, or the membership manager in the case of a membership vote. This must happen while the vote is in progress. If the member who calls in a vote has also left a proxy, the vote called in is the one that counts. One may also send in a vote by e-mail; to be valid, a copy of the vote must be put in the ballot box before the vote is counted.

## Process for Proposing Policies

- Policy proposals posted by the Board or by Managers become effective after 10 days unless concerns are expressed in writing to the Board by 10% of the voting members, the same percentage that is required to bring a proposal to community meeting.
- After a policy has hung and passed, a copy of the policy should be delivered to the Board for record keeping. If this does not happen, the policy will not be recognized because there is almost no way to find proof of the policy in the future. It is the responsibility of the person who proposed the policy to make sure the Board gets a copy for record keeping.
- Copies of existing policy and legislation affected by the proposed policy, and any Bylaws referred to, must also be posted at the same time.
- The proponent of a policy may use discretion in modifying and reposting a proposal in light of reasonable and well-thought-out concerns of fewer than 10% of voting members.
- If the proponent chooses to stand by a proposal that has been blocked by 10% of voting members, they must then post it for 10 days as a proposal to go to community meeting, have if fully sponsored by 10% of voting members, and then have it voted on as new legislation.
- After the 10 day concerns period, if policy passes, it is posted on &quot;New Legislation and Policy&quot; clipboard and entered into the Legispol Book.
- Proposals should have attached any corresponding legislation. Without which, the Board Chair will not sign off on the sponsored proposal.
- Any petition which is fully signed by two-thirds of full members must hang on the back board for 48 hours before being declared fully-sponsored by a board member. During this 48 hour period, members may add or remove their name. At the end of the 48 hours, if the petition still has the required amount of signatures, it can then be declared as fully sponsored by a board member. If the petition does not have the required amount of signatures, the petition is dead and must be re-petitioned.
- A fully-signed petition will not become valid until it has hung for 48 hours after having a Board member sign off on it.

## Sponsored Proposals Whose Original Sponsors Have Withdrawn Their Support

Sponsored proposals whose original proponents have withdrawn their support will be removed from the stack of sponsored legislation and destroyed after two weeks unless another member wishes to take on sponsorship of the proposal and present it.

## Community Meeting Day Set by Board

The day and time of day of Community meeting will be set by the Board after a binding poll of the membership.

## Community Decision Making

- Items intended for community meeting consideration will require the signatures of 10% of the voting members or be sponsored by the Board in an urgent or emergency situation, the reasons being posted.
- A proposal must be posted for at least 10 days prior to the community meeting at which it is considered, except in the case of urgent or emergency proposals as determined by the Board.
- A proposal will have no more than 30 days to garner the requisite signatures.
- After that time the proposal must be dropped or re-proposed.
- Each proposal will have one principal sponsor, who will be identified on the posted proposal. The proposal will not be discussed at community meeting without the principal sponsor or that person&#39;s representative.
- In order for a community meeting to occur, 15% of the voting members must be present.
- The principal sponsor (rather than the meeting) will have final say on what changes should be made to the proposal or if the proposal should be worked on further.
- After the final version of the proposal has been discussed in community meeting, the proposal is eligible for a vote by the community at large.
- The vote will take place outside community meeting. The final proposal will be dated and posted in a way that allows for additional written comment and debate. Members will have five days from the date of posting to vote yes or no on the proposal. Ballots will be available for members to sign their names and register their votes. Votes will be deposited in a locked box and will be counted by the Board or designated representatives.
- Any ballot without a legible name or any ballot without a name shall not be counted.
- A proposal passes if at least 20% of possible votes are in favor and outnumber &quot;no&quot; votes.
- Results will be posted. Each member&#39;s vote will be recorded and kept on file available to the membership.
- Meeting attendance **is** a requirement for voting or voting rights.
- Any proposal that has more yes votes than no votes, but fails due to low voter participation, will have its voting period extended by two days. Votes will not be released until the extension period is over. The revote notice must be prominently posted on the Dayboard. There may be only one extension period per proposal.
- In order for a vote to be extended, it must meet these aforementioned requirements:
- &quot;A proposal passes if at least 20% of possible votes are in favor and outnumber &quot;no&quot; votes.&quot;
- &quot;Any proposal that has more yes votes than no votes, but fails due to low participation, will have its voting period extended by two days.&quot;
- If it does not meet these requirements, it is considered a failed vote and will not be extended.

## Intermediate Proposal Process
### How to:
- A proposal is posted for signatures
- If the proposal gets 51% of voting members signatures, it can bypass community meeting. Instead it will go to the board meeting. The board meeting will only need the requisite three board members present, as stated in legislation, to be held. All community members will be invited to these meeting, with no exception. The board will post a note on the day board at least 5 days in advance of the meeting.
- The proposal must hang for 7 days after being fully sponsored.
- After the board meeting, a ballot will be printed.
- The voting period will be 7 days.
- Simple majority of votes will decide the outcome.
- Only items to go for vote can use this process (i.e. no discussion meetings)
- All membership issues are excluded he sponsor of the proposal can choose to bypass this process, and take the item to community meeting instead.

### Purposes
- Before community meeting, the Board will encourage members with ideas for changes in legislation to do the following:
  - Post the idea to see if there is interest and/or comments.
  - Set up a focus meeting of those who are interested to discuss the idea and possibly formulate a draft proposal.
  - Post the draft proposal for at least a week with space provided for comment, but not for signatures yet.
  - Reconsider the draft proposal in the light of community comment, perhaps in an-other focus meeting, before writing a formal proposal.
  - If it is an urgent or emergency item, ask the Board to consider scheduling the proposal sooner than it might usually come to meeting. The Board may waive the signature and posting time requirements.
  - If the proposal is simple or widely supported, the sponsor might leave space on the proposal for the signatures of two thirds of the full members, who may pass the proposal without it needing to go to community meeting. The fully signed proposal (petition) must hang for 48 hours before being declared fully-sponsored by a board member
- The Board&#39;s tasks before a meeting:
  - When the Board meets to schedule items for community meeting, it may suggest that more work on a proposal would be useful before a meeting; this will not be a requirement, however.
  - The Board may schedule proposals that contradict or that deal with the same subject to come up at the same meeting, so that differences and options may be fully explored. When scheduled for a vote, the competing proposal that has the most yes votes would be adopted, providing it gets the needed 20% of possible yes votes and has more yes votes than no votes. If competing proposals are posted and signed, but have not yet had enough time (10 days) to come to meeting, the Board may choose to delay the consideration of a proposal until the competing one is eligible for discussion in a meeting.
  - The agenda for community meeting as set by the Board may include suggestions for time limits on discussion subject to approval by the meeting. Sponsors of proposals should communicate to the Board what work the sponsor hopes to get done in the meeting in order that realistic and appropriate time limits may be set and should work with the facilitator to help focus the meeting.
  - The Board will post the proposed agenda at least 36 hours in advance of the meeting unless the Board deems an item to be urgent or an emergency.
  - The Board will attempt to avoid scheduling meetings and votes when large numbers of members are off the farm or otherwise unavailable.
  - The Board will attempt to secure a capable and unbiased facilitator for the discussion of the proposal.
  - The Board&#39;s general suggestions for process at community meeting:
  - The proposed agenda will be approved or not by community meeting including the time limits on discussion suggested by the Board.
  - The proposal will be introduced and explained by the sponsor or the designated representative of those who wrote it.
  - Questions may be asked by way of clarification.
  - Concerns about the proposal will be asked for.
  - Solutions to problems with the proposal may be suggested.
  - The sponsors might take the concerns of the group and do more work on the proposal before bringing it back to meeting. Volunteers may be solicited for a committee to do additional work on the proposal.
  - At the end of the time limit, the meeting may decide if the proposal should be discussed more at that time.
  - The sponsor may choose to separate from the proposal provisions that seem to be controversial and likely to cause the proposal to fail to be adopted. Those provisions may come up for a separate vote. If the provisions make no sense without the adoption of the part to which they were previously attached, the adoption might be contingent on the adoption of the other proposal.
  - If the principal sponsor is not interested in further changes, the proposal goes to a community vote.
  - Board Policy for voting on proposals outside community meeting:
  - The ballots will be readily available and generic. They will include a place for the name of the member, the words &quot;circle one&quot; or &quot;check one&quot;, under that &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, and a way to indicate which proposal the vote is for.
  - [Note: The current style of voting ballots also includes
  - a space to indicate whether FM or PM / bill 041904]]
  - The Board will maintain a lock on the ballot box.
  - The Board will count the ballots or designate vote counters and will ensure that more than one person is present when the ballots are counted.
  - If the vote is closely split the Board will consider whether there has been a failure in the process such that members&#39; concerns were not addressed; the Board may recommend reconsideration or review of the decision at a later date.
  - Process for a meeting that is for discussion only:
  - A manager, committee or individual member posts a proposal for a community meeting discussion of a particular problem or issue.
  - If signed by 10% of the voting members or sponsored by the Board, the issue goes to meeting.
  - The Board schedules the meeting and sets a time limit for discussion, subject to approval by the meeting.
  - After the discussion, the meeting is polled to see if there is interest in policy or legislation being developed on the subject.
  - If the community meeting would like policy to address the subject, the appropriate manager or committee (or the Board) will be asked to develop a draft policy.
  - If legislation is desired, then a committee of volunteers will be asked to draft legislation which will be brought back to meeting after being posted for the usual period. It will not require signatures to come back to meeting.

## Shared KITCHEN Policy

### General Intent

To provide a set of rules for the use of both the indoor and outdoor food processing space used for a large variety of projects including (but not limited to)

- meat processing
- canning
- cheese making
- dehydration
- fermentation
- incubation
- drying herbs/vegetables

Those who use it need to be considerate of each other&#39;s projects, as well as aware of general food safety guidelines to prevent cross contamination. Cross contamination could be devastating to some projects, as well as dangerous to our health.

### Food Safety Guidelines

The following guidelines should be stressed to any worker dealing with food:

- Keep hair under control by wearing a hair restraint (hair tie, bandana, cap).
- Wear clean clothing/uniform and/or apron.
- Keep fingernails clean, unpolished and trimmed short.
- Wear a bandage and plastic gloves if you have open cuts or sores.
- If you take a break, eat, smoke, cough, or sneeze, wash hands before resuming food processing.
- Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. You can&#39;t see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow these guidelines to keep food safe:
  - Clean — Wash hands and surfaces often.
  - Separate — Don&#39;t cross-contaminate.
  - Cook — Cook to proper temperatures.
  - Chill — Refrigerate promptly.

### Preparation

Always wash hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before and after handling food.

Don&#39;t cross-contaminate. Keep raw meat, poultry, fish, and their juices away from other food. After cutting raw meats, wash cutting board, utensils, and countertops with hot, soapy water.

Sanitize cutting boards, utensils, and countertops (see &quot;Clean Up&quot; section on page two).

Marinate meat and poultry in a covered dish in the refrigerator.

### Calendar to Sign Out the Space

A calendar system will help keep Kitchen clean and functioning smoothly. This is to ensure that the space will be available, and to prevent more than one project from happening at the same time. When signing out the space, please use the calendar.

Whoever has the space signed out gets priority; if you are trying to use the kitchen and do not have the space signed out, you may be asked to stop your project, leave, and return when the space is available. **Note on the calendar** _ **WHO** _ **,** _ **WHAT** _ **, and** _ **WHEN** _ **(approximate times are helpful). (For example, write on the selected date: 8am-4pm, Canning Tomatoes, Kurt)** 
**Label, Date, and Sign**

If you have any works in progress, be sure to label your project clearly. Note **what** you are making; include the **date** , and **who** is responsible for it. _Unlabeled projects are subject to being discarded._

### Clean Up

You are responsible for clean up of any and all messes that you make.

Clean all countertops, tabletops, work surfaces, and any equipment used. First wash them with hot soapy water, then wipe them down with white distilled vinegar, alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide at 3% dilution. Stubborn or stuck on stains may be scrubbed with salt or baking soda.

Wash all used dishes thoroughly, and put them away_. Clean dishes should never be left on counters or tables; put them on the clean dish rack; hang pots on hooks and utensils on the peg board. Dirty dishes should never be left (on a work surface or in the sink) for someone else to deal with. Empty compost into the active compost heap outside_. Take animal waste to the boneyard.

~~Take all dirty rags to the wash room and label for laundry worker to wash.~~

Place all dirty rags in the dirty laundry bags and text the kitchen manager to let them know how much laundry there is.

_Sweep the floor_. Also _mop the floor_ if you&#39;ve processed meat, or spilled anything that may attract flies, or is sticky or smelly.

_Please don&#39;t use bleach._ Use other cleaning methods such as hot soapy water, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or vinegar. If you feel you must use bleach use the proper dilution of one tablespoon of bleach to one gallon of water and always use **COLD** water.

### Non-food Projects

If you have a project that you would like to do in kitchen that is not food related (like making candles or soap, for example), please getthe Food Services Manager permission first. It is very important that we keep non-food safe and food-safe supplies and equipment separate.

### Failure to Follow Policy
Failure to follow this policy, or even just general disrespect for the space, may result in being asked to not use the kitchen anymore.

## Budgets and Financial Planning

Ultimate responsibility for the overall financial planning of the commons will lie with the Community and its members.
### Annual Plans

An Annual Plan (AP) will be made by Community each year, specifying an amount per budget. The Board and Finance Manager will make every effort to see that an Annual Plan has been passed by Community by or as near to SOME DATE as is practically possible. All departments are required to submit annual plans by 1 MONTH PRIOR TO DATE.

The Finance Manager will solicit budget requests from all departments as soon as annual elections are counted. Non-area perpetual budgets (utilities, taxes, etc.) will be proposed by the Finance Manager. As soon as the FM is finished compiling the proposed plan, the Board will make every effort to schedule an Annual Plan meeting promptly.

Any member may submit a line item to the Annual Plan by giving it in writing to the Finance Manager. Line items are intended to be one-time expenditures and not budgets which will come to exist in perpetuity (meaning they will require a budget every year thereafter). Line items and project budgets may also be passed using the normal proposal process and need not happen at Annual Plan time if Community feels they merit more time for discussion.

At the Annual Plan meeting, the Plan will be presented to Community. The Finance Manager will also present to Community at this time as accurate a picture of Community finances as possible, including monetary assets, debts, and a subjective picture of &quot;working capital&quot;. Budgets, projects and line-items may be discussed individually at this time. Any budget line may be adjusted in the meeting by taking a vote of the members present at that meeting. Line-items may be added or adjusted if the meeting decides to do so by vote. It is probable that creating a finished plan will take more than one meeting.

When the Plan is &quot;complete&quot;, a vote of those members at the meeting may send the Annual Plan to a paper ballot over 7 days for Community approval. Copies of the complete proposed Plan will be readily available to the membership at this time. If &quot;yes&quot; votes are more than 15% of total possible votes, and outnumber &quot;no&quot; votes, the Plan is passed and goes into effect immediately. If &quot;yes&quot; votes are less than 15% of total possible votes, or if there are more &quot;no&quot; votes than &quot;yes&quot; votes, the Board will schedule another Annual Plan meeting as soon as is practically possible, and the process will repeat until Community passes an Annual Plan.

Line items are NOT part of the overall plan vote, and are voted on individually. They pass or do not pass in the same manner the overall Plan does, excepting that if the overall Plan is rejected by the members, ALL line items are sent back to the Annual Plan meeting whether they passed on the first vote or not.

### Quarterly Review

Each Quarter, the Finance Manager will request that the Board schedule a Quarterly Review (QR) meeting. At that time, the FM will present, to the best possible accuracy, what has been spent from each budget through the quarter in question, and the updated picture of Community&#39;s monies, debts etc. that is presented at Annual Plan meeting.

In this meeting, any and all budgets may be discussed and/or altered by a vote of members present. The members present may then vote to send any proposed changes (if any) to a 7 day Community ballot which will be passed in the same manner as the Annual Plan is, excepting that if changes to the Plan are rejected there is no need to go back to meeting until the next quarter.

Line items may be added, deleted, or changed at QR meetings and are voted on individually in the way they would be at AP time (if and only if they are new or if an alteration is proposed).

QRs will be limited to one meeting.

As long as an AP or QR meeting is not on the stack at the time, any proposal may be made in the usual way that may affect any budget or line item within the AP at any time, as long as it does not conflict with other legislation.

Any expense outside of these meetings in the amount of $2,000 or more must be discussed in a community meeting before it can be funded.

## Members Sales

Outputs of the commons will be given to the members based:

- on the amount of shares?
- Number of people in household?
- Some other metric?

Food services department gets first dibs for preservation and prep.

Relatives, friends and visitors pay wholesale prices for everything (&quot;wholesale&quot; prices are half way between retail prices and cost).

## Extras Sales

If outsiders want extras the price will be determined by the food services manager and the finance manager. Cash or crypto only. The funds go directly into the commons account to be allocated at the next budget meeting.

# MISC
## Business Plans

There needs to be some process for people who are not managers to like start a business and use the commons, but not community funds. EX someone wants to graze alpacas with our herd or someone wants to start lessons at the firing range. Need to come up with a &quot;lease&quot; structure.
