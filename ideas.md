# Details
* Values
    + life, liberty, property
    + self-sufficiency and sustainabilty make for a long lasting community

## Land design 
* communal central or closest to the road/perimeter?
    + houses will have to be on the road or extra cost from county (300ft of frontage)
    + property along road costs more?
        + nah, but smaller plots should cost more/acre 
* property not along road would need a road or no car?
    + could work if you basically rent a spot from your neighbors.
    + i don't know if they would allow something like this without a road

* common space as a percentage of development?
    + 25%
    + 50%
    + 75%
    + probably depends on lot sizes
        + ex people want small plots (1 acre) if there are barns and garden spaces to rent. 
my main idea is like ok, you can buy however much you want and within there you have your choice to do whatever. However, lets say you buy 5 acres and your house and own barn and pool take up 1 acre. You should rent that back to the community at the going rate
        + we should only sell plots of a size  and then if you want more private space you can lease that at a rate (2x normal) for 5 years at a time. at the begining of a lease some set of tests should be done to gather metrics and deposit should be taken. If you screw up the metrics, then you loose percentage of your deposit. For example, i rent 5 acres that's wooded and turn it into a soccer field. because i destroyed some metric (biodiversity?), you are fined. So basically this is like there is no externality, you assume all cost. Another example, you turn 5 acres into a shooting range, but don't clean up all the shells. Your lease is up and you lose however much it costs to clean that up. 
* EX price/acre
    + 1+ acre 2x grand
    + 5+ acre 3x/2 grand  
    + 10+ X grand

## Governing structures 
* How to add stuff to this document
    + should be PR based. once it gets the set votes it gets pulled in. 
* ASYNCHRONOUS MEETINGS VIA TELEGRAM
* Monthly 3 hour town hall
* council
    + hunting
    + perenials
    + animals
        + rumanids
        + poultry
* town halls that you have to come to so often
    + if you miss absence of vote how is it counted (free loader problem)
* Decisions need to be made
    + how to sell a new plot
        + vote
            + each family gets 1 vote
            + each plot/coop share gets 1 vote
            + each person over age 25 gets one vote
* pricing
    + based on usage (see costa rica)
        + solar discount
        + adding species to graze discount
        + discount for less cement? 
    + knows trade that we need discount
        + teacher
        + carpenter
        + electrician
        + plumber
    + more people higher price
* Conflict resolution
    + what if jim wants to 
        + have a party and be loud
        + grow an invasive species
        + turn his lot into a junk yard
        + use fertilizers and insecticides
        + burn his trash
        + collude with govt entity X and snitch for all the things

## Commons
* pasture
    + see Appendix 1 for details
* kitchens
* showers
* barns
* natural pool
* freezers
* slaughter
* https://brownfieldagnews.com/news/mu-working-on-mobile-meat-processing-training-centers/
* seed bank
* shooting range
* campgrounds?
* workshops?
* laundry
* build a common wofati for folks to stay in while building their home
    + if 10x10 can follow permies plans exactly, 12x16 is ideal IMO

## field trips to communities for advice
* bear creek
* wheaton labs
* dancing rabbit
* freedomlanddao (ozarkia)
* east wind

## HOA ideas
* all citizens over age 18 armed
* must grow/hunt/forage x% of food yourself or purchase from co-op
    + increase this every Y years
* must produce x% of energy yourself
    + increase this every year


## Appendix 1 
* what if a land trust owns all the common land and then charges the standard county rate for a lease?
* if multispecies grazing, we could make a formula 
        ex $100/acre/year for ease of math. 
        farmer 1 - cows - 4 animal units
        farmer 2 - sheep 3 animal units
        farmer 3 - chickens 1 animal unit
        farmer 4 - pigs 2 animal units
        total animal units = 10
        farmer 1 pays 40% so he pays $40/acre/year. 

        another formula using grazing days
        something like ok, i have a chicken tractor and all i need is an acre for the whole year, but the cows and sheep can graze it before me. 

        tab system ()
        each acre needs to collect $100/year.
        if you're the only person grazing that acre you pay $100
        if someone else, then divide by percentage of animal units
        if you hit it twice and they only hit it once, multiply your animal units by 2 and then divide percentage of animal units. 
        if this is done, you basically need tables
            farmer 
            start paddock number
            end paddock number
            move date

            paddock number
            size
