&quot;I&#39;m tired of going to the grocery store, buying organic food, knowing that they&#39;re lying to me… There are people suffering from cancer and a long list of stuff and its all related back to nutrition. I want what&#39;s better for me, for my family. I want to blaze a trail, I can see it, I can feel it. I want to live in a plethora of life. I want to have the chickens, the pigs, the cattle, but mostly I want to have community. I want to live in a community where I feel like everyday I learn something new and these people give a shit like I do, in fact most of these people are better at this stuff than I am and I want to share a table with them. I don&#39;t want to be the smartest guy in the room, I don&#39;t want to be the permaculture guy in the room. I want to be middle of the road, because these people know so much more than I do and I&#39;m learning and were figuring things out together. These people care about what&#39;s good the same way I do. I want this richer, more glorious, more magnificent life and it&#39;s going to feature food that&#39;s above and beyond. I want it to be so great that I want to prove it, I want it to be an example… I want to live this more pure, more delicious life with people who have similar values, rather than swimming upstream. I want it to have so many redundancies that it doesn&#39;t require this enormous amount of work or discipline for it to happen. I have this thing in my head of how I want to live and I think I am not the only one who feels this way.&quot;

# The Commons as a subsidized agricultural space (Article X Option 0)

##  1. Proposals

Each business plans shall be presented to the board for approval to use portions of the commons. The board can enter into these agreements for no longer than their term.

##  2. Values by which business plans are evaluated.

The general intent is community preparedness. Variety and economy should be the first goals, closely followed by regenerative agricultural practices and nutrition.

Regarding plants – emphasis on perennials

Regarding animals – an emphasis on management intensive and rotational systems.

Regarding processing – an emphasis on long term low energy storage methods.

Regarding energy – an emphasis on renewable resources.

Regarding buildings – an emphasis on multi-use, natural building techniques and education.

Initial ideas:

* Firing range
* HAM radio tower
*  Camp ground
* Group house
* Airbnb
* Kitchen
  * Preserving equipment
    * Freezing
    * Canning
    * drying
  * butchering
* Showers
* Farming
  * Barns
  *  Cattle
  *  Sheep
  *  Chickens
  *  Seed bank
  *  hogs
* Natural pool

##  3. Perimeter fence:

This is going to have to be build by the community since animals will be in it. Here should be set out how its built.

# The Commons as a centrally planned farm (Article X Option 1)

See the document called permacultureCommunity sections on divisions, departments and mangers for the structure of this style of commons management.

# The commons as an anarchy playground (Article X Option 2)

the basic idea of this would be that there would be no governing body for the commons and the only thing this article would setup would be who arbitrates disagreements that happen in the commons. I feel like this is dumb, and more costly since the idea of this community is that we have similar ideals.
